# Class 16 -  Project Week: Milestone 1

## Final Project Overview

Here's the process that we'll be using for project week.
1. On the first day of project week, your team must submit a project proposal to the instructor, ideally during the morning.
2. During project week, your team must work on-campus so we can help whenever your team is stuck.
3. On the last day of project week, your team must present your project in front of the class.

## Project proposals

1. On the first day of project week, your team must submit a proposal to an instructor with the following information:

 - The name of your project
 - Your team's members
 - Your project's pitch: What is the problem statement and what are the benefits of your solution? Read more about these [here](https://www.bidsketch.com/proposal-resources/proposal-templates/web-design-proposal-template).)
 - A diagram of relevant details from your project's domain model
 - Wireframe sketches of your project's pages

 **TIP:** Use pencil and paper to diagram and sketch.

   Proposals, written or electronic, are due for review with the instruction team. First come, first served! After that, you are ready for the Launch Phase.

  **Due by 12pm on the first day of Project Week (usually Monday, unless there is a Monday holiday)**

## Launch Phase

Here are some tips on how to organize your team during the launch phase.

* Build a basic file scaffold from scratch **as a team**.
* Initialize a new Git repository (in a personal or organization account).
* Push it to GitHub and (optional) [add your team members as Collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).
* Note: As soon as you have a server.js going, which may not be immediately but should be soon, deploy your in-progress project to Heroku and [add your team members as Collaborators on Heroku] so that everyone can keep the deployment current(https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sharing).
* Once the GitHub world is set up, you're ready to enter the Build Phase!

## Build Phase

* Take your planning from the project proposal and turn it into a big to-do list (of items that individually will take 15-90 minutes to complete), and put that to-do list into a project management tool, such as GitHub Issues, Trello, or the like.
* Assign issues to team members and GO GO GO. Finish what you can on Day 1, and then plan on making Day 2 a HUGE build day.
