=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Today we will explore client-side route-based functionality to create a more performant and modular single page web application. These routes should be simple, with a single callback to render the page to the DOM.*

*We need to be attentive to when a server request is being made versus when the routing is intercepted and handled in the browser. We are finding new ways to blur the separation of concerns, in this case offloading some of the Controller responsibilities into the View layer.*
