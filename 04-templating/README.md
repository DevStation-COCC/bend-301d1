=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Templates have some advantages over direct DOM manipulation. Leverage those strengths in the blog by adding in a templating library! We use templating to abstract away the tiresome work of DOM rendering, and this practice is applied in many front-end libraries and frameworks.*

* Identify different approaches to reusable HTML templates
* Effectively use templates to present user-entered (or server-provided) data (methods on the Handlebars object).
* Distinguish between the different Handlebars expression types ( **{{}}** vs **{{{}}}** ).
* Modify and style typographic components (**serif, san-serif fonts, font-size, font-family, color, font-weight**, etc)
