## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Databases power web applications everywhere by enabling them to persist, modify, and query datasets to great effect. While there are many types of database options available now, Structured Query Language (SQL) remains the de facto standard for communicating with relational database systems. Let's build some SQL skills!*

*View this class and the next class and labs as a big two-part structure. It's all the same basic subject, but way too much for one day, so we've split it.*
