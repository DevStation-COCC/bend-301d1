# Class 15

## Overview

Today wraps up the book app and starts the transition into project week. Spend time filling in any gaps from this project so students feel prepared to complete any remaining feature tasks before project week kicks off.

There are several assignments this weekend: finishing and submitting the book app, completing the week 3 survey, and taking the 401 entrance exam, which serves as the 301 final exam. Encourage students to take time with the exam, as they only have one attempt to take it. It is not time-limited and they can use any resources available, such as their textbook, Google, Stack Overflow, etc. They can test any code snippets in the console, a code editor, or a website like repl.it. The exam is challenging though, so students should plan to spend an hour or two and make sure they have a quiet, distraction-free place to work on it.

The deadline to submit/resubmit assignments is Sunday evening at 11:59 p.m. There are no resubmits allowed during project week and any student whose grade is not at 90% after project week will need special permission to resubmit additional assignments after project week ends. Depending on the timeline for enrollment in 401, the timeline for these exceptions are important and admissions should be included in the conversation.

## How do I prep for today?
- Split students into groups of no more than 5 people. A size of 3-4 is typically able to handle the workload of a 301 project week.
- Review the project proposals in Canvas before class and be prepared to discuss some of the proposed ideas.
- Review the project requirements.

## General comments
The final exam is soon approaching so be sure to go over strategies with students - CodePen, REPL, etc. Also, point out that while some of the exam questions are intentionally tricky they can all be solved with close reading and proper use of available tools. Some "gotcha" questions are in quizes 3-6 that can be used as reference.
