## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Things are starting to change in a big way as we start looking at how server-side code works. The core lab task will be to build out a `server.js` file using Express that will replace the functionality students have been getting from live-server up to this point.*

*This lab is another one that is on the lighter side, but the next three labs are probably the toughest of the course. Resist the temptation to coast once you've completed the lab following this class! Make sure that you understand EVERYTHING in the starter code inside and out!!!*

## Readings
<!-- List of readings required for this content; readings being completed by the start of this lecture -->
* [Node.js introduction on tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_introduction.htm)
* [An Introduction to Node.js" on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)
* [The Node Beginner Book](http://www.nodebeginner.org/)

Not a reading, but useful: [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/) is your friend when you are trying to create/check JSON. It will help your track down malformed JSON.
